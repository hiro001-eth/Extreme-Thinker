hi claude these is me manjil working as a full time application developer i got a task so i am trying sonnet 4.5 version to get more familour today i will give you the raw structure prompt you need to give me harder and best result in the best way i want . 

first look above sample image these is the edit image of random screenshot of payment .

for the ai llm model training i am build an llm rag version of ai that learned with human generated the statement of financial transaction .

things you got the idea what to do right . 

let me just move into what i want . 
i want a software no highfy but extermely powerful i want 
1 frontend page for me look at the result and downloading the image the software created i can download it and preview it .

the image is the e-wallet screen shot in bluk average 300 screenshot 

i want same as a sample screen shot i have uploaded to you  there is -$5  and 5 is in red square which you need to change . and below it there is remarks which is indicate in blue recentagle way and below there is in red square indicating the date  and after it there is "at " which dont need to change but after it there is time am/pm  time is also in red square box indicating to changing every time in all different in 300 image generates once . 


no the moto there are also many things beside it like name username , user profile and all things you need to keep it as it is . 
in when i run the machine which is a program it should generaets all 300 images at once after doing all the operation correctly . 

now the how the operation is done :

1. amount should minimum 5 dollar and maximum 15 dollar but random not low not high then 15 dollar .
2. and the 300 image which is generates when the total amount then it should go minimum 3100 to 3500 dollar in all total .
3. date and time should change respectively every single time mostly change time but what about date?? in per day 150 dollar  to 200 dollar in same date but time should be different . 

4. it should started from january 1st to january 19th and in jan 1, jan3, 8, 11 , 17 these are the date you need to create more like in these day the transaction is done above 200 and below 250 dollor.

5. and in remaining days you need to make 100 to 170 dollar transaction but at then the end the 300 screenshot should have the total of 3100 to 3500 dollar in these january 1st to january 19th 

6. the screen image can be generates 300 to 350 if need to extened the tranaction .
7. the blue square indicates the remarks it should be variable , different everytimes like shopping , foods , lunched , pizza , burger like genz use most remarks in tranaction in ewallets add that random shoping and all . 


now what i want there should be only 1 fontend page which is showing the generates the result in jpeg format like pure and 100% real screenshot taken by samsung s21 moble like these below there should be the original navigation to showing it is taken from mobile . the ... in left coner and the <- in top right coner and above the little there is tick mark in green and WORDS IS WRITTEN CALLED "Complete" 


so i want all the 300 screenshot image should be look like the most realstic way like a genz use to do the finacial tranaction to do the things shopping and all . 

and how backend works . 

it should be most powerfull it should take time to generate the image in proper mobile aspect ratio it should be sooo random and powerful way backend should be soo advance use of top technology which use to generates my request in the most best way . 
i dont know how you will create use extermely power programming like c# , c++ , python and also java but make it done use the the most insane powerful libairies technology to generates the result when i click on start after uploading the screenshot then it should genarets i dont want othese use less features but i want to create the 300 screenshot fake . 


all these to train my real world project which will help the big financial market to prevent from the fake screenshot which is resolve to train make sure i can download the generates image .


go hard go extermely think twices to create the most advcance helpful tools for me .
