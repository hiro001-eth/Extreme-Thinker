Create a realistic notification screenshot generator that produces 350 unique images with authentic-looking transaction notifications, adhering to specific date distributions and visual requirements.

1. DATE & TIME DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
Date Distribution (Total: 350 images)
Generate random timestamps across these specific dates with exact counts:
DateRequired CountNotesJanuary 1192 imagesHighest volume dayJanuary 2136 imagesJanuary 3217 imagesJanuary 4162 imagesJanuary 11293 imagesPeak volume dayJanuary 12279 imagesSecond highestJanuary 13132 imagesJanuary 14183 imagesJanuary 15152 imagesJanuary 16112 imagesLowest volumeJanuary 17182 imagesJanuary 18116 imagesJanuary 19147 images
Implementation Algorithm
FUNCTION generateDateTimestamp():
    1. Create weighted array with exact date counts
    2. Shuffle array randomly (Fisher-Yates algorithm)
    3. For each generation, pop next date from shuffled array
    4. Generate random time (HH:MM format, 24-hour)
       - Hours: 00-23 (randomized)
       - Minutes: 00-59 (randomized)
    5. Ensure no duplicate timestamps (date + time combo)
    6. Format: "January [day], [time]" or "[Mon DD], [HH:MM]"

2. TRANSACTION AMOUNT REQUIREMENTS
Amount Range & Distribution

Total Pool: $3,100 - $3,500 USD
Per Transaction: Randomize amounts realistically
Suggested Range: $5 - $25 per transaction (varies)
Distribution: Use normal distribution centered around $9-10

Implementation
FUNCTION generateAmount():
    1. Use Gaussian/Normal distribution
    2. Mean: $9.50
    3. Standard deviation: $3.50
    4. Min cap: $3.00
    5. Max cap: $30.00
    6. Format: "$X.XX" (always 2 decimal places)
    7. Ensure total across 350 images = $3,100-$3,500

3. TOP NOTIFICATION BAR VARIATIONS
Critical Requirement
Every generated image MUST have a DIFFERENT notification bar to prevent detection of fake/repeated images.
Elements to Randomize
A. Status Icons (Left Side)
Rotate through realistic combinations:

Signal strength: 1-4 bars
WiFi: On/Off, different strengths
Cellular network: 4G, 5G, LTE
Airplane mode: Occasionally show
Bluetooth: On/Off randomly

B. Time Display (Center)

Use the same timestamp as the notification content
Format: 12-hour (3:45 PM) or 24-hour (15:45)
Vary AM/PM appropriately

C. Battery & System Icons (Right Side)

Battery percentage: 15%-100% (randomized)
Battery icon states: Charging/Not charging
Battery colors: Green (>50%), Yellow (20-50%), Red (<20%)
Alarm icon: Show/Hide randomly
Location icon: Show/Hide randomly
Rotation lock: Occasionally visible

Visual Specifications

Use authentic Android/iOS system icons
Match the device style consistently per image
Ensure icons are crisp, properly aligned, and sized
Status bar background: Match device theme (light/dark mode variations)


4. USD LOGO & AMOUNT VISUAL ALIGNMENT
Critical Visual Requirements
A. Logo-Amount Height Matching
REQUIREMENT: USD logo height = Amount text height (EXACT)

Implementation:
1. Measure amount text height in pixels
2. Scale USD logo to MATCH this exact height
3. Use proportional scaling (maintain aspect ratio)
4. Baseline alignment: Both should sit on same baseline
B. Spacing & Layout

Gap between logo and amount: 8-12px consistent
Vertical alignment: Center-aligned or baseline-aligned
Font weight: Medium to Bold for amount
Logo style: Professional, clean USD symbol or dollar icon

C. Reference Sample Image Analysis
ACTION REQUIRED:

Analyze the provided sample image dimensions
Extract exact:

Font size of amount
Logo dimensions
Spacing ratios
Color values
Padding measurements


Replicate these measurements EXACTLY


5. OVERALL REALISM REQUIREMENTS
Visual Authenticity Checklist

✅ Use actual notification design patterns (Material Design/iOS)
✅ Realistic app icons (payment apps like PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, etc.)
✅ Authentic notification text templates
✅ Proper typography (system fonts: Roboto, SF Pro)
✅ Accurate shadows, borders, rounded corners
✅ Appropriate notification timestamps
✅ Realistic sender names/app names
✅ Proper notification priority indicators

Text Variations for Notifications
Rotate through realistic messages:

"You received $X.XX"
"Payment of $X.XX received"
"$X.XX deposited to your account"
"New payment: $X.XX"
"You've got $X.XX"
"[Name] sent you $X.XX"


6. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
Pre-Generation Setup

 Create date distribution array (350 entries)
 Shuffle date array for randomization
 Initialize amount pool ($3,100-$3,500)
 Load notification bar icon assets
 Load USD logo assets
 Set up base notification template

Per-Image Generation Loop
FOR i = 1 to 350:
    1. Get next date from shuffled array
    2. Generate random time
    3. Generate random amount (track running total)
    4. Generate unique notification bar configuration
    5. Select random notification text template
    6. Scale USD logo to match amount text height
    7. Compose final image
    8. Validate visual accuracy
    9. Save with unique filename (e.g., "notification_001.png")
    10. Log metadata (date, time, amount)
END FOR
Post-Generation Validation

 Verify total image count = 350
 Verify date distribution matches requirements
 Verify total amount = $3,100-$3,500
 Check for duplicate notification bars (should be 0)
 Spot-check 20 random images for visual quality


7. OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS
File Naming
Format: notification_[sequential_number]_[date]_[time].png
Example: notification_001_jan01_1423.png
Image Specifications

Format: PNG (for quality)
Resolution: 1080x2340px (or match reference sample)
Color space: sRGB
Quality: High (no compression artifacts)

Metadata Log (CSV)
Generate accompanying CSV file:
image_filename, date, time, amount, notification_text, battery_level
notification_001.png, January 1, 14:23, $9.45, "You received $9.45", 87%

8. TESTING & QUALITY ASSURANCE
Visual Test Checklist (Sample 10 Images)

✅ Logo and amount are same height?
✅ Notification bar is unique?
✅ Timestamp looks authentic?
✅ Overall composition matches sample?
✅ No visual glitches or artifacts?

Distribution Test

✅ Run date count validation
✅ Verify amount total
✅ Check randomization (no obvious patterns)


FINAL NOTES FOR REPLIT
Key Success Criteria:

Generate EXACTLY 350 images
Match date distribution EXACTLY as specified
Total transaction value: $3,100-$3,500
EVERY notification bar must be unique
USD logo height = Amount text height (EXACTLY)
Images must be indistinguishable from real notifications
